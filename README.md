## Important!

- I forgot to mention in the video that you can abort the print by pressing the `esc` key or `q`(defineable in the config.json).

- Read the tos from the website you want to draw on. If the website disallows such things don't draw with the bot on it.

## Additional info:

- When you install an update i recomend deleting `guiConfig.json`. That makes shure that the gui is being displayed correctly.

- You can redising the gui by editing the `guiConfig.json` file. The order of the array displays the order of the gui elemments.

## Installation

- go to releases
- download the latest release
- extract the zip file into a folder
- run the `drawbot.exe`
- close the window again
- run `initializePositions.exe` and follow the instructions (abort/save with right click)
- run `drawbot.exe` again
- run `gui.exe`
- enjoy!

## Build

- clone repo
- have [c++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/) installed
- have [python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- have [nodejs 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- install pip requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- install npm dependencies (`npm install`)
- to build run `npm run build`

## faq:

- If the gui instantly crashes, try running the drawbot.exe and then the gui. The drawbot.exe creates all nessesery files for the gui to work.
