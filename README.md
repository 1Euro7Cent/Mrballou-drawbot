## Important!

I forgot to mention in the video that you can abort the print by pressing the `esc` key or `q`(defineable in the config.json).

## Installation

- go to releases
- download the latest release
- extract the zip file into a folder
- run the `drawbot.exe`
- close the window again
- run `initializePositions.exe` and follow the instructions (abort/save with right click)
- run `drawbot.exe` again
- run `gui.exe`
- enjoy!

## Build

- clone repo
- have [c++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/) installed
- have [python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- have [nodejs 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- install pip requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- install npm dependencies (npm install)
- to build run `npm run build`

## faq:

- If the gui instantly crashes, try running the drawbot.exe and then the gui. The drawbot.exe creates all nessesery files for the gui to work.
